### Spaceships game

Mini-project with Attila Mirk, Claudia Beresford, Edward Byne and Ming Chan.

After some brainstorming, we decided to try and create a realtime multiplayer game involving spaceships.

We made the decision to use [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) with [Express.js](http://expressjs.com/) and in particular WebSockets. We chose to use the JavaScript library for realtime web applications [Socket.IO](http://socket.io/).
